            <p>SpongeBob's skills as a fry cook could accurately be described as superhuman; in episodes such as
                "Help Wanted" and "Employee of the Month," he is seen making them at rates of hundreds or even thousands per
                minute. He has won 374 consecutive Employee of the Month awards at the Krusty Krab.</p>
